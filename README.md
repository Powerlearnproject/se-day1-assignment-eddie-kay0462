Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
answer=> Software engineering is the process of using engineering principles to desing and implement software sloutions that meet users needs.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
i)The development of programming languages such as C, C++, Fortran etc
ii)The advent of structural programming
iii)The establishment of software engineering principles and methodologies like scrum, waterfall, agile

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
i)Requirements: This involves the gathering and documentation of users needs and requirements through research etc.
ii)Design: Creating prototypes and wireframes of the software architecture and user interfaces
iii)Implementation: Writing code and building software based on the what is documented in the requirement phase
iv)Testing: Basically ensuring that all aspects of the software work as expected, either by testing individual units or how different parts of the software interact with each other
v)Deployment: Releasing the software into production for users to interact with
vi)Maintenanance: Provide continuous updates, support etc for the users based on feedback

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Contrasting the terms: Waterfall focuses on a more rigid structure of developing software where the team has to complete each project before moving on to the next. On the other hand, agile introduces a more flexible approach where teams can work on different phases of the project simultaneously. 
Comparing: Both are super useful methods in the software development journey. 
Agile would be very useful in cases where the team has enough time for a project while waterfall will be useful if a team has to meet a tight or strict deadline, and as such has little to no time for flexibility. 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
i) Software developer focuses on writing and implementing code logic for the software
ii) Quality assurance engineer ensures that the software works as expected, with all the different compenets working together.
iii)Project manager ensures the timely delivery of products and oversees the smooth transition from idea stage to deployment stage.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
i) IDE'S provide a platform for developers to write code, as well as other functionalities like intellisense which help boost productivity in the development life cyccle. Examples are VS- Code, Notepad++, ECLIPSE 
ii) Version control systems allow developers collaborate on projects in real time. Exmaples inclide git and subversion

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
i)Tight deadlines which compromises software quality
ii)Changing requirements which slows down software development and deployment
iii) Technical debt

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
i)Unit testing involves testing individual components of the software
ii)Integration involves testing how the different parts of the sotware work together
iii) System testing involves testing the whole system as a whole
iv)Acceptance invloves testing the software against user requirements

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering explains the process of structuring an instruction in a way that can be understood and interpreted by an AI model. It helps AI models give better responses to queries. 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt: Software as a service
Improved version: Explain software as a service to a novice programmer, and how it can be useful in modern computing
The improved version provides mcuh detail and is more user specific.
